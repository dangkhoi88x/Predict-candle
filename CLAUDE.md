# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
docker compose up -d          # Postgres on localhost:5544 (5432/5433 avoided on purpose)
./mvnw spring-boot:run        # app + frontend on http://localhost:8080
./mvnw test                   # all tests
./mvnw test -Dtest=WalletSignatureVerifierTest        # one class
./mvnw test -Dtest=WalletSignatureVerifierTest#method # one method
```

First run backfills ~40k candles per asset from Binance (2022-01-01 → now), 15–30s. Watch for
`Synced N candles for ...` in the log.

**Editing static files while the app runs:** `./mvnw -q process-resources` copies
`src/main/resources/` into `target/classes/`, which is where Spring serves static assets from.
The running server picks the change up on the next request — no restart. This does **not**
apply to `application.yaml` or Java changes; those need a real restart.

**Bundles:** `cd web && npm ci && npm run build` rebuilds both, each as an IIFE assigning one
global. Only needed when the matching source changes. Use `npm ci`, not `npm install` —
`package.json` uses carets, so an install can silently pull newer minors and produce a
different bundle from an unchanged source.

| source | output | global | loaded by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `web/src/wallet-auth.js` | `static/wallet-auth.js` (4.1 MB) | `CandleWallet` | both pages, deferred |
| `web/src/blog-editor.js` | `static/blog-editor.js` (395 KB) | `CandleEditor` | `admin.html` only |

IIFE takes exactly one entry, so these cannot be one multi-entry build — `vite.config.js`
switches on `--mode` and `npm run build` runs both.

`package.json` carries an `overrides` pin on **axios**. `@coinbase/cdp-sdk`, four levels down
under the Reown wallet adapter, depends on axios at an exact `1.16.0` — which npm cannot
upgrade past ten advisories, so `npm audit fix` loops and even `--force` proposes nothing. The
override is the only route, and it is safe because that path is tree-shaken out: bumping axios
to 1.20.0 leaves `wallet-auth.js` byte-identical. Do not delete it without re-running
`npm audit`.

## Architecture

### Round flow (the game)

```
Binance → CandleSyncService (backfill + hourly) → Postgres
                                                     │
                            RoundSelectionService — random window, rejects repeats
                                                     │      and near-flat "dead" charts
                            RoundTokenService — signs a JWT holding the answer
                                                     │
        GET /api/practice/round  ·  POST /api/practice/guess
```

The server keeps **no round state**. `roundToken` is a signed JWT carrying asset, window start
and which guess the player is on; the client sends it back with each guess. One chart yields
several guesses (`candles.round.guesses-per-chart`), each revealing one more candle.

### Auth

Wallet-signature login, no passwords. `GET /wallet/nonce` → client signs it → `POST
/wallet/verify` → server recovers the address and issues a session.

Access token lives **in memory only** (never localStorage); the refresh token is an HttpOnly
cookie, so `auth.js` silently POSTs `/api/auth/refresh` on load to restore a session.
`JwtAuthenticationFilter` authenticates the request as a bare `Long` principal (much of the
codebase pattern-matches on that) plus one authority, `ROLE_USER` or `ROLE_ADMIN`.

Since anyone can connect a wallet, **`.authenticated()` alone means "everyone"** on this app.
Anything narrower uses the role.

### Roles

Two: `USER` and `ADMIN`, on `users.role`. Who is an admin comes from `candles.admin.wallets`
(env `ADMIN_WALLETS`), not from the database — `AdminRoleReconciler` promotes listed wallets
and **demotes** unlisted admins at every startup, and `AuthService` promotes at login for a
listed wallet that has never signed in. So an admin screen cannot grant the role; editing the
config and restarting is the only way, which is deliberate (revoking has to be as easy as
granting). Change that class if that trade stops being worth it.

The role travels in the access token, so `hasRole(...)` in `SecurityConfig` costs no query.
That claim is a snapshot up to 15 minutes stale, so **anything that writes calls
`AdminAccess.requireAdmin()`**, which re-reads the role from the database. `User.assignRole`
also bumps `tokenVersion`, killing the account's refresh tokens on any role change.

### Frontend

Plain static files under `src/main/resources/static/` — no bundler, no framework, ES5-style
IIFEs, one global per file. All six views live in **one `index.html`**; `nav.js` toggles
`.hidden` between them and drives a `role="tablist"` (roving tabindex, arrow keys).

Script order in `index.html` matters: `pill.js` and `rolling.js` define shared globals that
later files call at load time.

| Shared module | Global | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `pill.js` | `CandlePill.attach(track, sel)` | nav + 6 asset/filter pickers |
| `rolling.js` | `CandleRolling.update(el, text)` | price, delta, scoreboard, ticker, heatmap |

`CandlePill` watches the `active` class via MutationObserver rather than clicks, so callers
keep their own click handlers unchanged and only add one `attach()` line.

**Deferred tabs:** `nav.js` has an `onFirstShow` map. Heatmap and blog build on first reveal,
not at load. Add to it rather than initialising a heavy tab eagerly — `loading="lazy"` does
**not** defer images inside a `display:none` view (an element with no box cannot be deferred
by position), so anything image-heavy must be built on demand.

### Admin frontend

`admin.html` is a second, separate page: a dashboard shell — sidebar, sticky topbar, and seven
panes of which exactly one shows. It shares `style.css`, `theme.js` and `auth.js` with the game
and nothing else.

**Pane switching is an attribute, never `.hidden`.** Every `admin-*.js` module already owns
`.hidden` on its own section and re-asserts it each time it hears `candles:admin` — so a nav
writing the same class would lose the pane the moment a module refreshed (press Sync in Vận
hành and watch it jump back). `admin-nav.js` sets `data-pane` on `.admin-panes` instead, and
CSS shows a section only when the container selects its pane **and** its module has not hidden
it. `body.is-admin`, set once by `admin.js`, is what hides the nav and panes before the server
has confirmed the role.

| Event | Fired by | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| `candles:admin` | `admin.js` | whether `/api/admin/me` said yes; every module loads off this |
| `candles:ops` | `admin-ops.js` | the ops snapshot, so the overview pane reuses it instead of fetching again |
| `candles:pane` | `admin-nav.js` | the pane just switched to |

`CandleAdminNav.go(pane)` is the way to move between panes from code — `admin-media.js` uses it
to take the blog editor's image picker to the library and back.

Overview charts come from `GET /api/admin/stats?range=week|month|year` (`AdminStatsService`,
cached 60s, bucketed in UTC; `&fresh=true` is the refresh button skipping that cache). The four
KPI figures do **not**: they come off the `candles:ops` snapshot, because two panes asking the
same question twice can only disagree.

**Two guess totals, and picking the wrong one is a visible bug.** A timed-out guess has no
`guessed_direction`, so each `AdminStats.Bucket` carries both `guesses` (every row — the
denominator `PlayerScore` and the ops panel already score on) and `answered` (long + short, the
chart column's height, because the legend says SHORT and LONG). Accuracy anywhere on the page
is `correct / guesses`; reading `correct / answered` instead runs about nine points high on
current data. `AdminStatsTest` pins both the split and the JSON field names the pane reads —
there is no shared schema, so a renamed record component would silently draw zeroes.

The blog body is **Tiptap in the admin, a ProseMirror document in `body`, and a hand-written
walker on the public page**. That split is the load-bearing decision:

- `admin-blog.js` holds only the handle `web/src/blog-editor.js` returns. It never imports
  Tiptap and never sees a ProseMirror object beyond the JSON going into the column.
- `blog-render.js` (7 KB) draws the same documents on the public page with `createElement`.
  Rendering them with Tiptap's own extensions would put 395 KB of editor in front of every
  reader, on the page whose weight this project spent a release cutting. It also means
  `blog.js` still never touches `innerHTML`.

**The cost is a coupling: every node or mark the editor can emit needs a branch in
`blog-render.js`.** Add a Tiptap extension without one and the public page cannot draw what
an admin just published. Unknown types fall back to their text and `console.warn` rather than
vanishing silently.

Two other things are deliberate. `Image` is a custom node carrying `width`/`height`, because
the public page reserves an image's box from them and stock Tiptap Image drops them — which is
also why `POST /api/media/images` returns dimensions, so a *pasted* image gets the same
treatment as a picked one. And an `href` is validated in both places: Tiptap refuses anything
but http/https, and `blog-render.js` checks again on the way out, because the editor is a
convenience and not the security boundary.

`body` still reads both shapes. V12 converted the seeded posts to documents, but a database
that has not run it yet holds the older flat block array, and opening one of those must not
present an empty editor that then saves over the post.

The topbar search (`admin-search.js`) searches the **rendered DOM**, not the modules' data —
every pane is built and in the document at once, only hidden by CSS, so the rows are all there
for free and no module has to expose its state. The index is therefore exactly what has
loaded: the content pane holds one kind at a time and the media grid holds the pages fetched
so far, and the empty state says so. Matching folds diacritics and collapses `- _ / .` to
spaces (so `van hanh` finds `Vận hành` and `cau truc` finds `cau-truc-thi-truong`), and reads
`title` attributes, which is where the full wallet address and Cloudinary id live while the
cell shows an abbreviation. Teaching it about a new pane is one entry in `SOURCES`.

Admin styling lives under `.admin-shell` and reads `--adm-*` tokens, a palette of its own —
soft grey ground, hairline borders, low shadow, against the game's near-black. The scope is
load-bearing: `.ghost-btn`, `.pill`, `.status` and `.field` are shared class names, and only
the `.admin-shell` prefix keeps the two pages from having to agree on how they look.

### CSS conventions

Everything reads tokens from `:root` in `style.css`; both themes swap only token values, and
no drawing code knows which theme is active (SVG presentation attributes take `var()` too).

- Motion: one easing `--ease-out`, four role-named durations (`--duration-fast/normal/enter/roll`).
  Never hard-code a duration — the `prefers-reduced-motion` block collapses the tokens, which is
  the only way it reaches animations that JS writes as inline styles.
- An `animation: infinite` cannot be handled by shortening its token (that just spins it
  faster); switch it off explicitly in that block, as `.ticker-track` and `.skeleton::after` do.
- `.rolling` (odometer digits), `.skeleton`, `.pill` are the shared primitives.
- Numbers get `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`.

### Patterns and heatmap

`pattern/` holds two libraries — candlestick (`PatternLibrary`) and chart-shape
(`TechnicalPatternLibrary`, which uses `SwingPivotDetector`). Cards render hand-drawn SVG
illustrations; "Tìm ví dụ thật" calls `/api/{patterns,technical-patterns}/{id}/example` to
scan real stored history for a genuine occurrence.

Heatmap has two sources behind one view: crypto (CoinGecko, called straight from the browser)
and S&P 500 (`/api/market/sp500` → `YahooFinanceClient`). `treemap.js` does the layout for both.

## Notes

- **Schema is Flyway's, not Hibernate's.** `ddl-auto` is `validate`: adding a field to an
  entity without a matching migration in `src/main/resources/db/migration` fails startup
  rather than silently altering the table. Existing databases predating Flyway are stamped
  at V1 by `baseline-on-migrate` and pick up V2 onwards.
- **Spring Boot 4.1.1 / Java 25**, and Jackson **3** (`tools.jackson.*`, not
  `com.fasterxml.jackson.*`) — this bites when hand-writing JSON handling.
- JWT uses `jjwt` with the **Gson** serializer to stay clear of Jackson 3.
- Static assets are served `Cache-Control: no-cache` (revalidate, not "don't store") and fonts
  get a year via `WebConfig`. Compression is on. Fonts are self-hosted with Latin + Vietnamese
  `unicode-range` subsets; there is no external font request.
- Blog images live in this project's Cloudinary account behind an `f_auto,q_auto` transform.
  Dropping the transform segment from the URL returns the untouched original.
- `ROUND_TOKEN_SECRET` and `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` default to dev values and must be set for real
  deployments. `ADMIN_WALLETS` is empty by default, which closes `/api/admin/**` and
  `/api/media/**` entirely rather than leaving them open. `MEDIA_ADMIN_WALLETS` is still read
  as a fallback for deployments that predate roles (`AdminWallets` logs a warning); move those
  addresses over.
- Config knobs (assets, backfill start, dead-round threshold, repeat cache TTL, visible candle
  count) live under `candles.*` in `application.yaml`.
