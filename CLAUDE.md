# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
docker compose up -d          # Postgres on localhost:5544 (5432/5433 avoided on purpose)
./mvnw spring-boot:run        # app + frontend on http://localhost:8080
./mvnw test                   # all tests
./mvnw test -Dtest=WalletSignatureVerifierTest        # one class
./mvnw test -Dtest=WalletSignatureVerifierTest#method # one method
```

First run backfills ~40k candles per asset from Binance (2022-01-01 → now), 15–30s. Watch for
`Synced N candles for ...` in the log.

**Editing static files while the app runs:** `./mvnw -q process-resources` copies
`src/main/resources/` into `target/classes/`, which is where Spring serves static assets from.
The running server picks the change up on the next request — no restart. This does **not**
apply to `application.yaml` or Java changes; those need a real restart.

**Wallet bundle:** `cd web && npm install && npm run build` rebuilds
`static/wallet-auth.js` from `web/src/wallet-auth.js`. Only needed when that file changes.
Vite emits an IIFE assigning `window.CandleWallet`; `web/` exists solely for this one bundle.

## Architecture

### Round flow (the game)

```
Binance → CandleSyncService (backfill + hourly) → Postgres
                                                     │
                            RoundSelectionService — random window, rejects repeats
                                                     │      and near-flat "dead" charts
                            RoundTokenService — signs a JWT holding the answer
                                                     │
        GET /api/practice/round  ·  POST /api/practice/guess
```

The server keeps **no round state**. `roundToken` is a signed JWT carrying asset, window start
and which guess the player is on; the client sends it back with each guess. One chart yields
several guesses (`candles.round.guesses-per-chart`), each revealing one more candle.

### Auth

Wallet-signature login, no passwords. `GET /wallet/nonce` → client signs it → `POST
/wallet/verify` → server recovers the address and issues a session.

Access token lives **in memory only** (never localStorage); the refresh token is an HttpOnly
cookie, so `auth.js` silently POSTs `/api/auth/refresh` on load to restore a session.
`JwtAuthenticationFilter` authenticates the request as a bare `Long` user id — there are **no
roles or authorities**, every authenticated user is equal. Anything needing narrower access
has to check something else (see `MediaController`, which matches the caller's wallet against
`candles.media.admin-wallets`).

Since anyone can connect a wallet, `.authenticated()` alone means "everyone" on this app.

### Frontend

Plain static files under `src/main/resources/static/` — no bundler, no framework, ES5-style
IIFEs, one global per file. All six views live in **one `index.html`**; `nav.js` toggles
`.hidden` between them and drives a `role="tablist"` (roving tabindex, arrow keys).

Script order in `index.html` matters: `pill.js` and `rolling.js` define shared globals that
later files call at load time.

| Shared module | Global | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `pill.js` | `CandlePill.attach(track, sel)` | nav + 6 asset/filter pickers |
| `rolling.js` | `CandleRolling.update(el, text)` | price, delta, scoreboard, ticker, heatmap |

`CandlePill` watches the `active` class via MutationObserver rather than clicks, so callers
keep their own click handlers unchanged and only add one `attach()` line.

**Deferred tabs:** `nav.js` has an `onFirstShow` map. Heatmap and blog build on first reveal,
not at load. Add to it rather than initialising a heavy tab eagerly — `loading="lazy"` does
**not** defer images inside a `display:none` view (an element with no box cannot be deferred
by position), so anything image-heavy must be built on demand.

### CSS conventions

Everything reads tokens from `:root` in `style.css`; both themes swap only token values, and
no drawing code knows which theme is active (SVG presentation attributes take `var()` too).

- Motion: one easing `--ease-out`, four role-named durations (`--duration-fast/normal/enter/roll`).
  Never hard-code a duration — the `prefers-reduced-motion` block collapses the tokens, which is
  the only way it reaches animations that JS writes as inline styles.
- An `animation: infinite` cannot be handled by shortening its token (that just spins it
  faster); switch it off explicitly in that block, as `.ticker-track` and `.skeleton::after` do.
- `.rolling` (odometer digits), `.skeleton`, `.pill` are the shared primitives.
- Numbers get `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`.

### Patterns and heatmap

`pattern/` holds two libraries — candlestick (`PatternLibrary`) and chart-shape
(`TechnicalPatternLibrary`, which uses `SwingPivotDetector`). Cards render hand-drawn SVG
illustrations; "Tìm ví dụ thật" calls `/api/{patterns,technical-patterns}/{id}/example` to
scan real stored history for a genuine occurrence.

Heatmap has two sources behind one view: crypto (CoinGecko, called straight from the browser)
and S&P 500 (`/api/market/sp500` → `YahooFinanceClient`). `treemap.js` does the layout for both.

## Notes

- **Spring Boot 4.1.1 / Java 25**, and Jackson **3** (`tools.jackson.*`, not
  `com.fasterxml.jackson.*`) — this bites when hand-writing JSON handling.
- JWT uses `jjwt` with the **Gson** serializer to stay clear of Jackson 3.
- Static assets are served `Cache-Control: no-cache` (revalidate, not "don't store") and fonts
  get a year via `WebConfig`. Compression is on. Fonts are self-hosted with Latin + Vietnamese
  `unicode-range` subsets; there is no external font request.
- Blog images live in this project's Cloudinary account behind an `f_auto,q_auto` transform.
  Dropping the transform segment from the URL returns the untouched original.
- `ROUND_TOKEN_SECRET` and `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` default to dev values and must be set for real
  deployments. `MEDIA_ADMIN_WALLETS` is empty by default, which closes `/api/media/**`
  entirely rather than leaving it open.
- Config knobs (assets, backfill start, dead-round threshold, repeat cache TTL, visible candle
  count) live under `candles.*` in `application.yaml`.
